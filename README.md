## Description

Sample payment gateway app built with NestJS ðŸ’¸

## Review notes

In order to follow the payouts logic, it is better to check [the e2e test suite](test/app.e2e-spec.ts).

- **System Configuration** is modelled as key-value storage at database level. It allows to easily add keys in the future.
- **% Fees** are accepted as fractions of 1, i.e. 5% is represented as 0.05. 
- **All fees are computed** and stored in the database **immediately** when the payment is accepted. It means that configuration
  changes do not affect historical payments.
- **Payouts API** is deliberately missing the validation on the payout limits (once a day) to facilitate testing.
- Payments can be prioritized for payouts using a strategy (see [payment-prioritization-strategy.interface.ts](src/payout/strategies/payment-prioritization-strategy.interface.ts)).
- By default `COMPLETED` payments are prioritized over `PROCESSED`.
